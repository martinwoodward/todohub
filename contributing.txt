## Important: Create an Issue First

**Before spending significant time on a pull request for a new feature, please create an issue first to discuss your idea.**

TodoHub is a personal project that I'm building primarily for my own use, and I'm pretty opinionated about what features and functionality I want to include. I want to make sure any feature you're considering aligns with my vision for the app before you invest your time and effort.

Bug fixes and improvements to existing features are always appreciated, but for new features, let's have a conversation first!

## How to Contribute
